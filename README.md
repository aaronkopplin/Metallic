# Metallic

Metallic is an open source Ethereum Smart Contract that allows usernames to be mapped to ethereum addresses. 

Metallic makes making ethereum payments easy by allowing payments to be made between easily recognizeable usernames like @bob or @alice, rather than traditional, difficult to read ethereum addresses.
